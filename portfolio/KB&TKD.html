        Tae Kwon Do is a martial art that originated in Korea. It focusses mainly on utilizing kicks but a fighter can also use their hands. It is a great martial art and sport for anyone to learn from young children to adults. It is great for cardiovascular health strength training, flexibility and more! 
        Kids especially benefit from it. Here at Seong Heas Martial Arts we teach the young students to abide by the five tenets of Taekwondo: courtesy, integrity, perserverence, self-control, and indomitable spirit. These principles will stick with each student inside and outside classes. Our owner and head instructor Tommy Bach grew up in Korea and recieved his black belt before coming to the United States.
        After moving to the US he started from a white belt and reworked his way to a black belt eventually becoming a 5th degree black belt in taekwondo recognized by the Kukiwon foundation. With over 40 years exprience and over 20 years of teaching experince, Tommy can help anyone from an expert to an absolute begginer.

    <p id="jump" class="bold">
        Head coach Tommy Bach has been practicing kickboxing since he was a teenager. He has competed in many large tournaments, 
        including five successful world championship bouts. He has been practicing and training fighters since he opened up his own gym. From 
        competition boxing to cardio kickboxing, there are many options for classes. Whether you want a good workout or want to know how to 
        defend yourself, kickboxing at Seong Heas Martial Arts will help.

        Taekwondo is a martial art that originated in Korea. It is a great martial art and sport for anyone to learn, from young children to adults. It is great for cardiovascular health, strength training, flexibility, and more! 
        Kids especially benefit from it. Here at Seong Heas Martial Arts we teach the young students to abide by the five tenets of Taekwondo: courtesy, integrity, perserverence, self-control, and indomitable spirit. These principles will stick with each student inside and outside the gym. Our owner and head instructor, Tommy Bach, grew up in Korea and recieved his black belt there before coming to the United States.
        After moving to the US he started from a white belt and reworked his way to a black belt, eventually becoming a 5th degree black belt in taekwondo recognized by the Kukkiwon foundation. With over 40 years of competition and teaching experience, Tommy can help anyone from beginner to expert. <br>
